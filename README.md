DCI (Data-Context-Interaction) in PHP

hp-experiments
--------------
My own experiments using contexts, roles and roleplayers in PHP. Please see the README.md in that subdirectory.

php-dci-libs
------------
Some other implementations of DCI in PHP.
Planned:
* Fatty: originally for Laravel. Uses closure object binding. See http://kirkbushell.me/data-context-interaction-for-php/. Code on https://github.com/kirkbushell/fatty.
* CoreDCI: can be used in PHP 5.3 (no traits). Used in http://code.google.com/p/waxphp/. See http://code.google.com/p/php-coredci/wiki/UsingCoreDCI
* the reverse wrapper
